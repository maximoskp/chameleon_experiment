# CHAMELEON_noblend

This is the code for the online version of the CHAMELEON melodic harmonisation assistant that includes blending.

In this version several things are not working properly and several things are missing, but they will all be worked out
gradually.

To be added:
- a proper UI for harmonising with all blends
